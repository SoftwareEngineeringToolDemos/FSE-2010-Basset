                            =============

Basset is a tool and framework that allows users to systematically test
actor programs that compile to Java bytecode. Basset is an extension 
for the Java PathFinder model checker developed by NASA Ames. Basset 
can currently check actor programs written in the Scala programming 
language or the ActorFoundry library for Java.


Running Basset
==============
To run basset:
bin/jpf +basset.language=foundry gov.nasa.jpf.actor.Basset pi.Driver 3

To see a complete list of Basset options, omit the subject driver and subject 
arguments:
bin/jpf +basset.language=foundry gov.nasa.jpf.actor.Basset

Alternatively, the test driver for pi can be run using .jpf files (if they exist):
bin/jpf src/examples/pi.jpf


The Basset Project
==================
Basset was originally developed at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign.
