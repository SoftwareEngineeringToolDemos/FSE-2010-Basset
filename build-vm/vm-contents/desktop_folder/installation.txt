Basset is a tool and framework that allows users to systematically test actor programs that compile to Java bytecode. Basset is an extension for the Java PathFinder model checker developed at NASA Ames. The installed Basset tool on this virtual machine box can check actor programs written in the ActorFoundry library for Java.

Download Instructions:

    1. Download the latest version of the Java PathFinder core (jpf-core) from the JPF website(http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/install/start). (You should choose to download and build JPF from the Mercurial source repository; the provided binary snapshots are for an older version of jpf-core that is not compatible with Basset.) The following instructions assume that you will use default directory locations when installing JPF.
    2. mkdir ~/projects/jpf
    3. cd ~/projects/jpf
    4. hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-core ( Although this instruction is given on the website, the current installation on virtual machine 
       works only with http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/raw-attachment/wiki/projects/jpf-core/jpf-core-r1038-src.zip. The author as of now, has not updated the jpf-core version that works well for Basset. This is the alternative the author recommended for Basset)
    5. Download the latest version of the Basset extension (jpf-actor) from the JPF source repository.
    6. cd ~/projects/jpf
    7. hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-actor
    8. Make sure to create a JPF site.properties file in your ~/.jpf directory as directed in the jpf-core installation instructions. Add the location of the jpf-actor extension to this file. If you have not previously used JPF, your site.properties file should look something like:
        
        jpf.home = ${user.home}/projects/jpf
        jpf-core = ${jpf.home}/jpf-core
        jpf-actor = ${jpf.home}/jpf-actor
        ...
        extensions=${jpf-core}

    ** Note **: Make sure you put the site.properties file in the $HOME/.jpf folder.

Build Instructions:

    1. Use ant to build the jpf-core and jpf-actor projects.
    
       cd ~/projects/jpf/jpf-core
       bin/ant
       # ... lots of output, at the end you should see something like:
       # BUILD SUCCESSFUL
       cd ~/projects/jpf/jpf-actor
       bin/ant
       # ... lots of output, at the end you should see something like:
       # BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Usage instructions:

    1. To explore the ActorFoundry subjects provided in src/examples, run Basset under JPF, additionally specifying the fully qualified class name for the subject's test driver along with any applicable arguments for the driver. 
    2. For example, the following command will test the ActorFoundry program "pi" using one master actor and three worker actors. This may take a minute to run.

       bin/jpf gov.nasa.jpf.actor.Basset pi.Driver 3
